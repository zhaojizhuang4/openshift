= Persistent Storage

## Creating Persistent Storage

The Cassandra database should stores its data to persistent storage in order to prevent data loss.

For each Cassandra node you deploy, you will need a persistent volume with sufficient data available. You do not need to directly manage peristent volume claims as the deployer and templates will take care of that for you.

Please see the link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html[OpenShift documentation] for how to setup and configure persistent volumes.

For example if you have a NFS server running on localhost with an exposed directory at `/persistent_storage/pv01`, the following command will generate a 10 gigabyte persistent volume:

----
$ oc create -f - <<API
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolume
    metadata:
      name: my_pv
    spec:
      capacity:
        storage: 10Gi
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
        - ReadWriteMany
      persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle
      nfs:
        server: localhost
        path: /persistent_storage/pv01
  API
