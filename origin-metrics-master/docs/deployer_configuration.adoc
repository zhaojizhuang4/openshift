# Deployer Configuration

## Deployer Secrets

The following table contains more advanced configuration options, detailing all the secrets which can be used by the deployer:

[cols="2,4",options="header"]
|===

|Secret Name |Description

|*_hawkular-metrics.pem_*
|The *_pem_* file to use for the Hawkular Metrics certificate. This 
certificate *must* contain the `hawkular-metrics` hostname as well as the 
publically available hostname used by the route. This file is
auto-generated if unspecified.

|*_hawkular-metrics-ca.cert_*
|The certificate for the CA used to sign the *_hawkular-metrics.pem_*. This 
option is ignored if the *_hawkular-metrics.pem_* option is not specified.

|*_hawkular-cassandra.pem_*
|The *_.pem_* file to use for the Cassandra certificate. This certificate 
*must* contain the `hawkular-cassandra` hostname. This file is 
auto-generated if unspecified.

|*_hawkular-cassandra-ca.cert_*
|The certificate for the CA used to sign the *_hawkular-cassandra.pem_*. This
option is ignored if the *_hawkular-cassandra.pem_* option is not specified.

|*_heapster.cert_*
|The certificate for Heapster to use. This is auto-generated if unspecified.

|*_heapster.key_*
|The key to use with the Heapster certificate. This is ignored if
*_heapster.cert_* is not specified

|*_heapster_client_ca.cert_*
|The certificate that generates *_heapster.cert_*. This is required if
*_heapster.cert_* is specified.  Otherwise, the main CA for the OpenShift installation
is used. In order for link:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.html[horizontal pod autoscaling]
to function properly, this should not be overridden.

|*_heapster_allowed_users_*
|A file containing a comma-separated list of CN to accept from certificates
signed with the specified CA. By default, this is set to allow the OpenShift service
proxy to connect.  If you override this, make sure to add `system:master-proxy` to the
list in order to allow link:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.html[horizontal pod autoscaling]
to function properly.
